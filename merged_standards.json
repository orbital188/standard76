G. ions) are required to solve a problem and  they are not available according to the problem conditions, the required particles can be obtained by decomposin g a substance of a higher structural level (e.g. molecules).  To create high pressure of hydrogen, a hydrogen forming substance in placed to a sealed vessel, and hydrogen is released by electrolysis."

To reduce hydrodynamic resistance of water, it is proposed to create water molecular complexes by electromagnetic field."

When combining particles of a lower structural level, the easiest way is to complete the nearest lower element.  A lightning rod which is made as a hollow glass tube filled with rare gas which is electrically neutral. When the lightning strike s, the gas is ionised and becomes electrically conductive. Then it recombines back to neutral state and does not create a radio shadow."
